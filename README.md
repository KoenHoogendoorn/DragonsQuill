# Dragon's Quill is an editor to help write and run D&D adventures in a more structured way

When I prepare my games in a word like editor I get disorganised quickly. I like to write short descriptions of relevant NPC's, locations and possible monsters at the top of the document. When I'm actually writing out possible scenes and I need to look up details from an NPC I eventually get lost and frustrated by all the scrolling. Other worldbuilding tools were a bit too extensive for me, I wanted a more simple tool.

So I created a system that uses digital index cards. The subjects of these cards can be linked to while writing out scenes so you can quickly find the relevant information.

I set up a version with some demo content that you can edit. Nothing gets saved.

You can find the demo here: https://dragons-quill.web.app/
